# paired-end-variant-calling
This repo provides a bash script for paired-end variant calling of NGS derived RNA-seq data. The pipeline is designed to work for SARS-CoV-2 Variant calling.
It also contains an R script that is used to visualize the results. The script assumes you've de-novo assembled a genome which you've annotated using Prokka.
